        <p>Hello! My name is Chihea Locke and I am currently a Junior at York College of Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Visual Communications. I have worked in web-based designs, databases, graphic design, and logo creation. Outside of schoolwork, I am the captain of Dance Excel, a hip hop dance group at York College of Pennsylvania and an active member of a sorority, Phi Mu.</p>
    
        <p>Currently, I'm working on my own projects to develop more of my skills as well as pursing my passion for art and photography.</p>
        
        <p>Below are links of mine that document my projects and artwork.</p>
